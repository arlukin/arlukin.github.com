<h1><a href="{{ site.url }}">Welcome</a><br/><abbr>14 Jan 2011</abbr></h1>

Welcome to my public information store, where I will publish
Swedish & English articles related to private projects that I have.
Instead of writing notes and text and store them privately on my
computer, I share some of them here instead.

You might find text copied from other people without me referring to
them. The intent was not to steal anybodies work. The text has probably
ended there because I might have copied the text to my private notes,
and then forgot that I hadn’t written it, and then published it here.
If you find any material such as that, please tell me.

If you for some obscure reason like to copy some of my information and
publish it somewhere else, it will probably be OK, but drop me an email
first (or after). It’s always nice to know if someone had use for my
work. Maybe I can add a link to you from my page and vice versa.

If you for some reason like to send an email to me, send it to articles@cybercow.se.

// Daniel
