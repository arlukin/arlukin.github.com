Welcome to my public information store, where I publish
Swedish and English articles related to projects I'm involved in.
Instead of writing notes and store them privately on my
computer, I share some of them here.

You might find text copied from other people without me referring to
them. The intent was not to steal anybodies work. The text probably
ended here because I copied the text to my private notes, and then
forgot that I hadn't written it myself, and then published it here.
If you find any such material, please tell me.

If you for some obscure reason like to copy some of my information and
publish it somewhere else, drop me an email. It's always nice to know if
someone had any use of my work.

If you like to send me an email, click [here](mailto:articles@cybercow.se).
