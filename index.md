[Welcome]({{ site.url }})<br/><abbr>14 Jan 2011</abbr>
======================================================

Welcome to my public information store, where I will publish
Swedish & English articles related to projects I'm involved in.
Instead of writing notes and text and store them privately on my
computer, I share some of them here.

You might find text copied from other people without me referring to
them. The intent was not to steal anybodies work. The text probably
ended here because I copied the text to my private notes, and then
forgot that I hadn’t written it myself, and then published it here.
If you find any such material, please tell me.

If you for some obscure reason like to copy some of my information and
publish it somewhere else, it will probably be OK, but drop me an email
first (or after). It’s always nice to know if someone had use for my
work. Maybe I can add a link to you from my page and vice versa.

If you like to send me an email, click [here](mailto:articles@cybercow.se).
