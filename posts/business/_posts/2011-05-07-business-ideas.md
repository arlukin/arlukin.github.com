## Things I would use myself

* Webpage for renting summer house/apartments/cottages on weekly basis.
* Similar idé that www.spreadshirt.com but another branch. For example
  the traveling business, everybody could set up their own Internet
  travel agency. Design their own travels with flight and hotel, then
  my company will handle that actual delivery of payment, tickets and
  vouchers.
* Movie rental system. Rent movies with the same model that video
  stores uses.<br/>
  <br/>
  Example of movie rental systems.
  * [www.roku.com](http://www.roku.com)
  * [www.boxee.tv](http://www.boxee.tv)
  * [the-boxeebox-cookbook](http://www.deviceguru.com/the-boxeebox-cookbook/#more-3477)
  * [Netflix](http://linuxdevices.com/news/NS8633598605.html)
  * [Blockbuster](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS2260476179.html)
  * [Blockbuster streaming box](http://gizmodo.com/5114333/blockbuster-streaming-box-review-mediocre)
  * [Linux connects TVs to 'Net video](http://www.linuxdevices.com/news/NS8281048541.html)
  * [myka](http://www.myka.tv/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=47&Itemid=55)

  Sell the system to video stores and share the revenue, maybe like
  spreadshirt.com.
* Email database/system with only “verified emails”. To remove all spam.
  Everybody in the system can email to each other and to people
  outside the system. But if someone not using the system emails
  someone within the system, they will get an email back telling them
  that they need to register in the “verified email database”. When
  receiving email, verified emails will end up in the Inbox, all
  other in a “spam-not-verified-folder”. To register in the system
  the user must prove that they are who they say they are, by phone
  (like on freessl), bankid, knowing someone in the system or other
  secure way. If someone is not behaving they will be baned. Possible
  to tag messages as newsletters if it’s a mass post, and they will
  end up in a separate folder.
* Build a taskmanagement/knowledgebase system.
* Build a house building site, with the focus on “tudor” style. It
  will contain webshop with furnitures and building materials. Selling
  “house-jewelry” like gargoyles, faces on walls, animals holding
  balcony on their shoulders, animallamps etc.
* USB-memory with the appearance like a ZIPPO-lighter. Ads together
  with the zippo-flipper webpage.
* Community and trix page around the NFN webbpage.
* Mobilephone/iphone/PSP/computer games.
* Applications and webpage I use, can I create a new one that is better?
  Internet phone/Messenger/Webmail/Emailprogram/FTP-program/P2P
  program/Bittorrent-downloader/Programmering editor/Projecthandling
  system/Advertisement page(ebay/blocket)

## Things I probably wouldn’t use myself

* Find a page with many hits, to see what other people are interested
  in. Possible to create a new businesses around that?
* http://se.php.net/links.php Developers and Job Opportunities
* Computer Grid Network
  Users can attach their own computer to the network, the computer
  will be dedicated to the GRID network when they are not using the
  computer. They will later be paid for the time the computer have
  been used. The customers pays for each hour and computer they are
  using. Maybe X kronor / cpu-points and time. Maybe the user selling
  computer power can set their own price, and buyers can set a price
  they like to buy for.
* Consult AB<br/>
  Income<br/>
  Consult project 500 kr/hour * 20 hours/week * 50 weeks/year = 500 000 kronor<br/>
  Expenses<br/>
  Salary 23 000 * 1.36 * 12 = 375360:-<br/>
  Office 5000 * 12 = 60 000<br/>
  Accounting 10 000+3000*12=46000<br/>
  Other 18640<br/>
  Total: 500 000
