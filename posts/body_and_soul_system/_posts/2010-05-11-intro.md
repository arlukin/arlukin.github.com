This section contains loosely coupled articles and notes about my Body & Soul system. The Body & Soul system is a vision of habits, policies and routines that will give me a healthier and happier life. To introduce new habits and routines in my life I will use 30 days of trail.

A System are developed, installed and continuously improved. This is not a project which has a start and an end. This system will continue forever, it's a lifestyle.

## Sleep

Goal: Get up at the same time every morning, from Monday to Sunday.

The goal is to get up at the same time every morning, from Monday to Sunday. That is more important then getting into bed at the same time everyday. Start with sleeping for 8 hours. Then when you feel that you are not tired during the day, and are used to the system. Maybe after 2-3 weeks, you can start to experiment with how much sleep you need. Go to bed 15-30 minutes later, and just sleep for 7:30 during 1-2 weeks, and see if you get more tired or not.

Currently my sleep will be between 23:30 and 07:30.

[From Steve Pavlina](http://www.stevepavlina.com/blog/2007/10/how-to-wake-up-feeling-totally-alert/)

*Here's what success in early rising looks like. You wake up early, and you feel wide awake and very contented. There will be some variation from day to day, but overall you're alert and functional. As you get up, it feels like your conscious mind is going through a rapid boot-up process. You may remember having an interesting dream. You'll also begin to think about the coming day. This all happens within a matter of seconds.*

*If you don't like the way you spend your mornings, you may suffer the problem of waking up without getting up. A good morning routine can help remedy that. It's important to have something to look forward to that makes you eager to get out of bed. In this particular area, the rule is to do whatever works for you. If playing your favorite video game for an hour helps motivate you to get out of bed early, try it for a few days and see how it goes.*
