title: Software Development Life Cycle
---

This is the SDLC checklist that we used in the early days of
[Fareoffice](http://www.fareoffice.com). It can be seen as all steps used in a
14-28 days sprint. In some way I think it's still very valid.

M = Manager/Product owner.
U = User of the product.
R = Reviewer
D = Developer

* 2-8h - Stories/Requiremnts (MURD)
* 2-4d - User documentation (Think Document Driven Development) / Requirement documentation. (D)
* 2h - Review (RD)
* 2h - Acceptance (MURD)
* 2-4d - Architecture/Detail design/Tasks/Issues (D)
* 2h - Review (RD)
* 2h - Acceptance (MRD)
* 10-25d - Implementation (D)
* 1-2d - Testing (RD)
* 2-8h - Acceptance test (MURD)
