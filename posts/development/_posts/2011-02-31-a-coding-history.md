This is a list of some of my early work, that has been stored on my
hard drive for a decade.

#### 971211 – ErocDarh [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971211_Eroc_Darh_1.00.zip) [(download src)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971211_ErocDarh_src.tar.gz)
This is a simple English/Swedish language training program. I did
write it to learn more about ODBC/Database applications in MVC++.

#### 971211 – The Other Side 1.04.100 [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971211_Tos_1.04.100o.zip) [(download src)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971211_Tos_1.04.100o_src.tar.gz) [(read more)]({{ site.url }}/posts/development/1997/12/11/tos/)
This a game developer editor for 2D games.

#### 971022 – KillAPP [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971022_KillAPP.zip)
This program was made to fool [Nebol](http://www.nebol.se/) when he where
using the Explorer in win95. But instead [Gandalf](http://www.torrentialrain.com/)
and [Dennis](imatmcdonalds.wordpress.com) were tricked with it. The only
thing the program do, is that
it views a .bmp on the screen and you can’t quit it. The .bmp should be
an Gfx Rip of explorer or some other program. Then change the short cut
to that program and when the user wants to run the program it seems like
it crashes all the time. Funny isn’t..

#### 970406 – Text Screen Saver [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/970406_Text_Screen_Saver.zip)
This is my first win32 program. It’s a screen saver that shows a text
message on the screen, you can change the message. Written with MVC++ 4.2.

#### 950919 – AsmLink [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/950919_AsmLink.zip)
This is a source code template I used when I linked asm with C++ .

#### 941202 – Mandel [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/941202_Mandel.zip)
This is the source code for a mandelbrot fractal demo. It uses the
CO-processor, written in asm.

#### 940828 – Old CD 1.0 [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/940828_Old_Cd_1.0.zip)
OCDE.EXE The English version.
OCDS.EXE The Swedish version.

This program is a modified version of cd (change dir). Which can go back
to last directory and store/load path bookmarks. Much like the pushd,
popd in linux.

#### 940709 – RawView 0.01 [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/940709_Raw_View%200.01.zip)
This program is written in Turbo Pascal. It displays an raw bitmap
picture with or without palette.

#### 940709 – PcxToRaw [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/940709_PcxToRaw.zip)
This program is written in Turbo Pascal. It converts pcx pictures to raw
bitmaps.

#### 940213 – EchoChar [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/940213_EchoChar.zip)
My my first program in Assembler.

#### 931221 – Nibbles The Best. [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/931221_Nibbles_The_Best.zip)
This is a Nibble game written by me and my friend P@bLo. It was written
at school time a long time ago. It worked fine on the 386 computers, but
it will run to fast on modern computers.

#### 931111 – TextSave [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/931111_TextSave.zip)
With this program you can cut out one row from one file and paste it
into another file. It can be very useful when choosing files to download
from a BBS file list.

#### 931020 – Sinus View 1.1 [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/931020%20_Sinus_View_1.1.zip)
This is a sinus manipulating demo.

#### 931020 – Sinus Demo 1.1 [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/931020%20_Sinus_Demo_1.1.zip)
This is a simple Demo written in TurboPascal.
