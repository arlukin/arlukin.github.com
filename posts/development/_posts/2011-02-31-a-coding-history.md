Here is some of the software/projects I have created since I learned
software development.

#### 110910 - Open Archive Network [(github src)](https://github.com/oan/oand)
A prototype of a distributed filesystem/database written in python.

#### 110910 - download-github.py [(github src)](https://github.com/arlukin/cchome)
Downloads (clone/pull) all repos for a github user, including all organizations
(s)he is involved in. Uses the github api. I use this script to backup all
my github repos.

#### 110829 - "homenet" [(github src)](git@github.com:arlukin/homenet.git)
At the moment only html code, for a accommodation rental system. I'm planning
to start a web-page where people can find accommodations to rent for their
hollidays, such as cabbins, apartments, bed&breakfast etc.

#### 110226 - [arlukin.cybercow.se](http://arlukin.cybercow.se) [(github src)](https://github.com/arlukin/arlukin.github.com)
My own blog/article website rebuild in jekyll and hosted on github.
On this page I publish Swedish & English articles related to projects
I'm involved in. Instead of writing notes and text and store them
privately on my computer, I share them on this webpage.

#### 110225 - Random shell scripts [(github src)](https://github.com/arlukin/home)
This repo holds files that I usually have in my /home/arlukin folder.
It can be config files, scripts etc.

#### 110212 - Fareoffice Shell [(github src)](https://github.com/arlukin/fosh)
A bunch of sysadmin functions used at Fareoffice. The goal with this
project is to have a script that can be executed once and then remotley
install all servers.

#### 100606 - Bluetooth spam [(github src)](https://github.com/arlukin/dev/tree/master/bluetoothSpam)
Linux shell script that tries to send a file to all bluetooth devices
around.

#### 100416 - Amivono shop [(github src)](https://github.com/arlukin/avshop)
This is a C++ based webshop I started (never finished) to write on,
when experimenting with [c++ Web Toolkit](http://www.webtoolkit.eu/wt)
and doing webapplications in C++. I was thinking about to use it to
sell Z-Wave devices for home automation.

#### 091207 - [gberga.cybercow.se](http://gberga.cybercow.se)
A website full with stories about the people grown up in Berga, written
by Johnny. I did the coding, this is the third version of the site.

#### 090417 - [photo.cybercow.se](http://photo.cybercow.se) [(github src)](https://github.com/arlukin/photo.cybercow.se)
My private photo album stored on the Internet. Some functionality written
in php, and a "stolen" flash application.

grandmothers father 1910, and has been in the family since then. It's
available for rent on weekly basis. And this is the info about the
renting conditions.

#### 051023 - [nfn.cybercow.se](http://nfn.cybercow.se) [(github src)](https://github.com/arlukin/nfn.cybercow.se)

This a small java midlet "Tamagochi" app, that I did to test to write
applications for my cellphone. The application shows a picture of
[nebol](www.nebol.se), and then the user can click a couple of buttons
to feed him etc.

#### 040118 - Total Firepower [(github src)](https://github.com/arlukin/dev/tree/master/totalFirePower)
When I was in seven or eigth grade we playes the classic game
[Firepower](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fire_Power_(video_game)),
since then I have liked tank games. Then during late 1997 Cavedog
entertainment released the best RTA game ever,
[Total Annihilation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Total_Annihilation).
A couple of years after that I started to think about writing a new
version of the old Firepower game, based on the community units for TA.
This is the result, nothing much. I just made it possible to load a
map from TA and to scroll over it. (But I'm still thinking about doing
this, maybe for the new popular ios or android platforms.)

#### 000111 - CyberCow Virtual Office 2000 [(spec)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/000111_ccVO2k System Dokumentation.doc) [(src)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/000111_ccDev.zip) [(release)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/000111_ccVO2k.zip) [(ccLib doc)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/000111_ccLib.zip)


This is an application used to work with virtual projects. The project
information are stored centrally on a server, and people around
the world can then fast and easy reach their project information over internet.
I was planning to build a business around this software, but instead I
got caught in the [Fareoffice](http://www.fareoffice.com) (and still are.)
This is my largets c++ application so far (2011).

#### 980426 - ccNoteIt [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/980426- ccNoteIt.zip)
A note taking program written in Visual Basic . My first and last vb app.

#### 971211 - ErocDarh [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971211_Eroc_Darh_1.00.zip) [(download src)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971211_ErocDarh_src.tar.gz)
This is a simple English/Swedish language training program. I did
write it to learn more about ODBC/Database applications in MVC++.

#### 971211 - The Other Side 1.04.100 [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971211_Tos_1.04.100o.zip) [(download src)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971211_Tos_1.04.100o_src.tar.gz) [(read more)]({{ site.url }}/posts/development/1997/12/11/tos/)
This a game developer editor for 2D games.

#### 971022 - KillAPP [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/971022_KillAPP.zip)
This program was made to fool [Nebol](http://www.nebol.se/) when he where
using the Explorer in win95. But instead [Gandalf](http://www.torrentialrain.com/)
and [Dennis](imatmcdonalds.wordpress.com) were tricked with it. The only
thing the program do, is that
it views a .bmp on the screen and you can’t quit it. The .bmp should be
an Gfx Rip of explorer or some other program. Then change the short cut
to that program and when the user wants to run the program it seems like
it crashes all the time. Funny isn’t..

#### 970406 - Text Screen Saver [(download)]({{ site.file_url }}/a_coding_history/970406_Text_Screen_Saver.zip)
This is my first win32 program. It’s a screen saver that shows a text
message on the screen, you can change the message. Written with MVC++ 4.2.

This program is a modified version of cd (change dir). Which can go back
to last directory and store/load path bookmarks. Much like the pushd,

This is a Nibble game written by me and my friend P@bLo. It was written
at school time a long time ago. It worked fine on the 386 computers, but
